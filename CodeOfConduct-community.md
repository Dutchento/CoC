# Dutchento Community Code of Conduct
We expect all participants in our community to follow the Code of Conduct rules buth online and offline at all event venues and related social events.

## Purpose

Even people that used osCommerce or VirtueMart. It's ok, we've all been there.

## Scope
### ...of Dutchento
* Since our focus is on supporting Magento people and business in The Netherlands, which means we are usually restrictive with adding people not doing business in- or with The Netherlands. There are other community sites - like [Magento's own forums](https://community.magento.com) and [Stackexchange](http://magento.stackexchange.com) -  that are better suited for international discussions.
* Magento experts, international speakers at our events or people outside The Netherlands doing business here will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
