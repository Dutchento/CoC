# Dutchento Volunteer Code of Conduct

First off: **THANK YOU** for volunteering your time and dedication. You are the face of our organisation and the responsibilities you have are crucial to the succes of our event. It is our incredible volunteers who are the true engine of our community.

To make everything go as smooth as possible we created this document to be clear about some general responsibilities and expectations.

*Interested in volunteering? Contact us at volunteer@dutchento.org.*

If you have any questions or concerns at any point along the way, please don't hesitate to contact your main contact within the organization.

## Purpose
1. Dutchento exists to support the local Magento users by making their lives easier, more profitable and more fun & to introduce others to our platform and community. As a volunteer, this is the main goal that you are supporting.
2. All community members - including you as a volunteer - are expected to abide by our general [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Dutchento/organization-code-of-conduct/blob/main/CodeOfConduct-community.md). This document can be seen as an extension to that document, specifically for you.

## Expected behavior
1. As representatives of Dutchento towards the rest of our community, volunteers are expected to be model citizens abiding our [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Dutchento/organization-code-of-conduct/blob/main/CodeOfConduct-community.md).
2. You are expected to support community members in showing desired behavior and ask people to stop unacceptable behaviors.
3. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.
4. Volunteers will be assigned certain tasks and timeslots which need to be followed stricktly. If for whetever reason you are unable to fulfill this, call your organization contact person asap so we can look for a solution.
5. When in your role as a volunteer you represent Dutchento to the outside world and not yourself or your company. So for example:
   * Don't recruit people for your company
   * Don't invite people to non-Dutchento events
   * You should be objective in your advice
   * Handle in accordance to the interest of Dutchento and Dutchento's partners/sponsors.

## What To Do If You Witness Or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior
If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible.

The organizing team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
Organization and Volunteers will be wearing recognizable clothing. You can also refer participants to the special registration desk in the lobby and ask for the organizers.
